<div>Everyone would like to have son/daughter immediately after the marriage. Those who are affected by Putra dosham may find themselves without any children/ delay in getting the children.‘Puthra’ means child. The word ‘Dosha’ has several meaning like blemish, mistake, a problem or an imperfection. Putra dosha, the flaw that pertains to children is a very popular term in Vedic Astrology. It comprises of all types of faults that may be related to one’s children as seen from the horoscope. The Fifth house from Lagna represents progeny. Jupiter is Puthra Karaka. The Lord of the Fifth, and Jupiter, should be placed well to ensure children. The Lord of the 10th is also connected with the native getting a legal heir. Fifth house is the Puthra sthana (house indicating children) for a male and any malefic planets in this fifth house creates Puthra Dosha (imperfection in child birth) to the native. Jupiter is the puthra karaka(planet indicating children). If the 5th lord, Jupiter and 5th house is affected by malefic planets then the person suffers due to Puthra Dosha mainly due to progeny problems. Factors indicating Puthra Dosha are the Lord of the Fifth being ill placed, Jupiter in a weak position, and the Fifth house and Jupiter receiving malefic aspects. In such cases, the coming of progeny may be delayed, and even denied. The role of Maha Dasa-s and Bhukthi-s is relevant too. Competent and experienced astrologers can recommend possible ways to overcome the effects of Puthra Dosha found in a horoscope. For a female both the fifth and ninth house in the horoscope are to be analyzed for the child birth. Usually ninth house is called as Puthra Sthana for women but still, fifth house indicates the nature of womb (ovary) and conception. Any malefic in 5th or ninth house in the horoscope of female creates some problem in child birth. Rahu in 5th house delays child birth and in most of the cases they suffer abortion if any malefic like mars or Saturn aspects Rahu. They beget only female children. If ketu is posited in 5th house, they suffer childlessness for a very long period and they may beget a male child long after 8 years of marriage. If moon or mars is posited in fifth house they beget more female children. If Saturn is posited in 5th house, they may go in for adopted child. For a perfect analysis of progeny, Rasi chart and Sapthamsa chart of both the husband and wife should be analyzed and this cannot be explained here in detail.Also, fifth house indicates ancestral assets, love affair, luck in speculation, personal mantra favorable deity etc. weak fifth house and malefic in fifth house spoils the ancestral assets. They also face failures in love affairs. They should also avoid involving in speculation which might put them in to disappointments. Planet in fifth house indicates the type of mantra one would choose to chant and attain perfection (mantra siddhi).It is always good if no planet occupies 5th house (puthra sthana). Even benefic planet like Jupiter in 5th house creates dosha. 5th house is also called as poorva punya sthana.
